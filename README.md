What is this
A project that can call the google search API with all the indexs that you think are useful

Why use this
At this age of information explosion, access to information is no longer a problem. The problem is to find quality information. I find it really useful to keep some people that I find that are experts in the field and find out what they have to say in a certain topic. I would type in the topic I'm interested in and there name into Google. This has helped me a huge ton to learn faster.

How to use it
Create a database of people or blogs, and the topics that they are experts in.
